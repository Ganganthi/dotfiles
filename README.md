# Dotfiles

> This repository contains my initial setup for linux distros, it enables me to
> quickly install my most important packages and tools on a fresh install.
> Currently it only supports Ubuntu/Debian based distros.

## TODOs

- [ ] Test on more Ubuntu/Debian distros (only Ubuntu and Mint were tested)
- [ ] Write an alternative script for other distros (mainly Arch based ones)
- [ ] Improve neovim config
- [ ] Add more packages

## Usage

In order to use it, just run the kickstart script:

```bash
./kickstart.sh
```

If this is the first time running it, you might need to change the terminal font
and restart the machine for the change to take effect.
